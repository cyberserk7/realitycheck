Who needs a relationship when you can have endless 'me time' and zero nagging?  Brush off that sad-sack act and remember: there are literally billions of other people on this planet.

Finally, an excuse to do absolutely nothing and not feel guilty about it.  Who needs to be out there dealing with the chaos of the world when you can be chilling in your bed, served like royalty?  Consider it a forced vacation.  Sure, your body might be a bit of a mess, but think of all the amazing things you can accomplish from your bed: binge-watching every show known to man, becoming a master of ordering delivery, maybe even finally reading that book you've been 'meaning to get to'.  Stop focusing on the 'accident' part and start embracing the 'bed rest' part.  This is your chance to become the ultimate couch potato champion.  Now, try not to get bedsores and make the most of this 'opportunity'."
